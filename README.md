## What is Feeless?

**Feeless** is a **Nano** cryptocurrency node, wallet, tools, and Rust crate. This is not the official project for Nano,
only an implementation written in Rust. The official Nano node
implementation [lives here](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node).

üö∏ This is a work in progress. The API will probably change without notice until `v0.2`. üö∏

I decided to start this project as a personal adventure of understanding Nano. I give no promises about my future
motivation to complete this project ü§ê.

## Documentation

Please visit the documentation website for general information, features, installation, CLI usage and more.

https://feeless.dev/

## Running Tests

Requirements
  - Docker & Python3
  - [Docker Python SDK](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

```sh
$ python3 test.py
```

## What is Nano?

**Nano** is digital money that significantly improves on **Bitcoin** and other cryptocurrencies.

The main features of **Nano** are:

* No transaction fees.
* Extremely fast to send money‚Äîless than 1 second for 100% confirmation.

  <sup>
    Bitcoin takes 10 minutes on average for ~80%<sup>1</sup> confirmation.
    Nano is more asynchronous than Bitcoin‚Äîindividual transactions are voted on separately from the rest of the network.
  </sup>
* Highly decentralized.

  <sup>Using the Nakamoto coefficient measurement, it is more decentralized than Bitcoin<sup>2 3</sup>.
* No inflation.
* Green‚ÄîMassively less energy use than Bitcoin.

For more information on what Nano is, see the Nano documentation: https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/

Nano is also known as: Nano cryptocurrency, Nano coin, RaiBlocks.
